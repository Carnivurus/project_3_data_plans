#### Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze data from Instacart, a grocery delivery platform similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash. The objective is to perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The provided dataset has been modified to include missing and duplicate values, replicating a real-world scenario where data isn't always clean. The main tasks involve loading the datasets, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and summarizing key insights.

#### Objectives

1. Load and inspect various datasets related to Instacart orders.
2. Preprocess the data by identifying and correcting data types, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
3. Provide clear documentation of the steps taken, including exploratory analysis and visualizations.
4. Draw intermediate and final conclusions based on the analysis.

#### Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
